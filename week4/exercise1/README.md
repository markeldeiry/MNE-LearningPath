# Memory Game

Create a memory game using HTML/CSS/JS that allows the user to "flip" cards until they've found all of the matches.

To start the game you click a card, it "flips" to reveal the text. This text remains as you flip a second card. If the two cards match, then they stay flipped over, if they do not match, then after a second or two they turn back over so the text is hidden. Once all matches have been found the user should get an alert letting them know the game is finished.

Ideas to make it more interesting:

- Add a timer
- Shuffle the cards each time the page loads so the game is different each time
- Allow the user to choose how many cards the game has
